# Configure a webhook on an Azure Activity Log alertS

Webhooks allow you to route an Azure alert notification to other systems for post-processing or custom actions. You can use a webhook on an alert to route it to services that send SMS, log bugs, notify a team via chat/messaging services, or do any number of other actions. This article describes how to set a webhook on an Azure Activity Log alert and what the payload for the HTTP POST to a webhook looks like. For information on the setup and schema for an Azure metric alert, [see this page instead](insights-webhooks-alerts.md). You can also set up an Activity Log alert to send email when activated.

>[AZURE.NOTE] This feature is currently in preview, so expect variable quality and performance.

You can set up an Activity Log alert using the [Azure PowerShell Cmdlets](insights-powershell-samples.md#create-alert-rules), [Cross-Platform CLI](insights-cli-samples.md#work-with-alerts), or [Azure Monitor REST API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn933805.aspx).

## Authenticating the webhook
The webhook can authenticate using either of these methods:

1. **Token-based authorization** - The webhook URI is saved with a token ID, eg. `https://mysamplealert/webcallback?tokenid=sometokenid&someparameter=somevalue`
2.	**Basic authorization** - The webhook URI is saved with a username and password, eg. `https://userid:password@mysamplealert/webcallback?someparamater=somevalue&foo=bar`

## Payload schema
The POST operation contains the following JSON payload and schema for all Activity Log-based alerts. This schema is similar to the one used by metric-based alerts.

```
